##Telegram bot for watching movies.

It works through the api of a third-party site. 

There is also a small problem, it is related to the fact that the links to the shows do not open. They do not open due to the fact that when requested the server looks for the title "Referer" and if it is absent, the player will show a download error. 

Solved the problem banal, bought a domain and hosting, and simply redirected from this hosting, to that link.
